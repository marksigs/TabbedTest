</P>
<P><H3>Purchase price / Estimated value: </H3>this field does 
not need to be completed.&nbsp; However it will help to provide a more accurate 
availability of products if it is completed, as it can take account of the 
lending criteria in deciding which products are appropriate. If this field is 
not completed, the loan to value cannot be calculated, and the one-off costs are 
also not shown.
<P><H3>Amount requested: </H3>this is the total amount 
required by the borrower. This field must be completed.
<P></P>
<P><H3>Term: </H3>the number of years over which the borrower 
wishes to pay back the loan.
<P></P>
<P><H3>Part and Part?: </H3>if the borrower requires part of 
the mortgage to be calculated on an interest only method, and the other part on 
capital and interest, select ‘Yes’ then click on the ‘Split’ button. The amount 
required on an interest only basis should then be entered. Clicking on 
‘Calculate’ works out the remainder that will be on a capital and interest 
basis.
<P></P>
<P><H3>Search: </H3>once the loan amount and term details have 
been entered, click on ‘Search’ to discover the products that are available for 
the borrower. If the search fails to produce any products, it may mean that 
there are none suitable for the borrower’s requirements. Firstly check that all 
details entered are correct.
<P></P>
<P><H3>Further filter?: </H3>to look for a specific type of 
product and not show all the products available, select ‘Further filtering’. In 
the top of the pop-up box select ‘Further filtering’, then choose the types of 
products required. Select ‘OK’ to be returned to the main Mortgage Calculator 
screen, then click on ‘Search’ to display the selected type of product.
<P></P>
<P><H3>Stored illustrations:</H3>by selecting this option, 
previous illustrations produced can be redisplayed. In the pop-up box, select 
the illustration and click on either ‘Details’ to display the product details, 
or ‘Reinstate’ to activate a previously stored quote. (see MC020 and MC030).
<P></P>
<P><H3>Calculate: </H3>to produce a quotation based on the 
amount required and the term, click on ‘Calculate’. Illustrations are shown at 
the bottom of the screen and show the monthly repayments for both capital and 
interest and interest only methods (and part and part if previously selected).
<P></P>
<P><H3>Details: </H3>to see further details on a specific 
product, highlight it and click on the ‘Details’ button.
<P></P>
<P><H3>Incentives: </H3>to see any monetary incentives 
associated with a particular product (eg. cashback, refund of particular fees 
etc.) One-off costs: this pop-up shows costs associated with the mortgage 
product, such as arrangement fees and stamp duty costs.
