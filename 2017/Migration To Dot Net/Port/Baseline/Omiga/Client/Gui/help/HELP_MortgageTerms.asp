<P></P>
<P></P>
<A NAME="LTV"></A><P><H3>LTV (Loan To Value): </H3>this is the size of the 
mortgage as a percentage of the value of the property or the price you are 
paying for the property
<P></P>
<P>Eg. if the loan amount is £70,000 and the value of the house is £100,000, the LTV is 70%, leaving 30% equity in the property</P>

<A NAME="EarlyRedemptionPenalty"></A><P><H3>Early Redemption Penalty: </H3>this is a fee charged by the lender if the borrower pays off all or part of the mortgage before an agreed date, or if the mortgage is moved to another lender.  These charges usually apply on <A href="HELP_TypesOfMortgageProduct.asp#FixedRate">fixed</A>, <A href="HELP_TypesOfMortgageProduct.asp#DiscountedRate">discounted</A> or <A href="HELP_TypesOfMortgageProduct.asp#CashbackMortgage">cashback</A> 
mortgages. It can be a percentage of the loan amount or a fixed fee. 
<P></P>
<P>Eg. if a fixed rate term is 2 years, and part of the mortgage is redeemed during this period, an early redemption penalty may be charged by the lender.</P>

<A NAME="LockInPeriod"></A><P><H3>Lock in (tie in) period: </H3>this can be found on many <A href="HELP_TypesOfMortgageProduct.asp#FixedRate">fixed</A>, <A href="HELP_TypesOfMortgageProduct.asp#DiscountedRate">discounted</A> or <A href="HELP_TypesOfMortgageProduct.asp#CashbackMortgage">cashback</A> 
mortgages. The borrower will be ‘locked in’ to a particular interest rate for a 
specified period of time.
<P></P>
<P>Eg. if the rate is fixed for 2 years, then the borrower will not be able to make any capital repayments or move the loan to another lender without incurring a charge (<A href="#EarlyRedemptionPenalty">Early Redemption Penalty</A>)</P>
<P>With some mortgage products, the lock in period will continue after the special interest rate has finished.  </P>
<P>Eg. if the rate is fixed for 2 years, the borrower may be locked in to the <A href="HELP_TypesOfMortgageProduct.asp#SVR">SVR</A> for a further period of time</P>

<A NAME="CapitalRepayment"></A><P><H3>Capital repayment (also known as capital reduction / part redemption): </H3>this occurs when the borrower makes a lump sum payments 
to the lender to reduce the capital amount owed on the mortgage. Some lenders 
specify minimum amounts they will consider as capital reductions.
<P></P>

<A NAME="APR"></A><P><H3>APR (Annual Percentage Rate): </H3>this is the rate of charge on a loan calculated to a set formula.  As well as the rate of interest, it includes associated costs (eg. <A href="HELP_FeesAssociatedWithMortgages.asp#ArrangementFee">arrangement</A>, <A href="HELP_FeesAssociatedWithMortgages.asp#ValuationFee">valuation</A>, redemption and <A href="HELP_FeesAssociatedWithMortgages.asp#LegalFee">solicitors</A> 
fees). It is meant to enable the borrower to make a meaningful comparison of 
rates charged by different lenders. 
<P></P>
<A NAME="ValuationReports"></A><P><H3>Valuation reports: </H3>a valuation is a check of the property to find out how much it is worth and whether it is suitable security for a mortgage.  It is carried out on behalf of the lender, although the borrower will usually receive a copy of the report.  There are different types of valuation depending on the borrower’s requirements, and each of the valuation types incurs a different <A href="HELP_FeesAssociatedWithMortgages.asp#ValuationFee">fee</A>.
<P></P>

<P><A NAME="BasicValuation"></A><H3>Basic valuation: </H3>
<P>this is carried out on behalf of the lender purely to assess the adequacy of 
security for mortgage purposes. It is very limited in scope although will 
highlight any essential repairs.</P>
<A NAME="Fullstructuralsurvey"></A><P><H3>Full structural survey: </H3></P>
<P>this is a thorough and complete inspection of the property carried out by a 
qualified professional surveyor, engineer or architect. It will discover any 
defects in the property.</P>
<A NAME="HomeBuyersReport"></A><P><H3>Home Buyer’s Report: </H3></P>
<P>this is half way between the basic valuation and the full structural survey. 
It is limited in focus but will highlight defects.</P>
<A NAME="LendingCriteria"></A><P><H3>Lending criteria</H3></P>
<P>: these are a set of ‘rules’ built into the lender’s policy, which govern to whom loans will and will not be made and types of property which is or is not acceptable.  For example, lenders may decide that they will not lend any more than 90% <A href="#LTV">LTV</A>, or to people who have previously been in arrears.  Each lender’s criteria will differ slightly, although many share common policies regarding, for example, on people with <A href="#CCJ'S">CCJs</A>.</P>
<P><H3>Redemption: </H3></P>
<P>this is the total repayment of the outstanding mortgage debt.</P>
<A NAME="CCJ"></A><P><H3>CCJs (County Court Judgements): </H3></P>
<P>when a person is unable to pay his creditors, a civil case can be brought 
against them in the County Court. The Court can make a judgement against the 
debtor which then remains in force until such time as the debt is paid. Many 
lenders will not consider applications from people with CCJs unless they have 
been satisfied for a specified number of years. Some lenders however directly 
target people with CCJs and charge them higher rates of interest.</P>
<A NAME="IncomeMultiples"></A><P><H3>Income multiples: </H3></P>
<P>most lenders use income multiples to decide how much an applicant can borrow. 
The multiple applied takes account of gross annual salary, and sometimes 
bonuses, overtime and other income, however the volatility of the other income 
must be assessed (only used if regular and / or guaranteed). If there are two 
applicants, both salaries can be used but a different multiple will be 
applied.</P>
<A NAME="FurtherAdvance"></A><P><H3>Further advance: </H3></P>
<P>this is further borrowing taken out in addition to the existing mortgage, for 
purposes such as home improvements. It is generally administered as a separate 
mortgage account.</P>
