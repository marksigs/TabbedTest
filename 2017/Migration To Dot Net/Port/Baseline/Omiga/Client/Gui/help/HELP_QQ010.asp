<P><H3>Income and outgoings: </H3>this screen takes basic 
details regarding the applicant’s income and outgoings, to assess whether the 
applicant can afford to borrow the amount requested.
<P></P>

<P>Selecting the down arrows next to the ‘total monthly outgoings’ and ‘total monthly personal debt repayments’ fields brings up a dialogue box, which makes it easier to calculate the total outgoings.  </P>

<P>For example, next to the ‘total monthly outgoings’ dialogue box displays a list of common outgoings (housekeeping, utilities, council tax, insurance premiums, car and travel, other).  The amount and frequency for each of these is entered, then by pressing ‘Calc’, a total is calculated, and by pressing ‘OK’, this total is carried to the main screen.</P>

<P>The ‘total monthly personal debt repayments’ dialogue box can be completed in a similar manner.</P>

<B><P>Note: </B>   using 
the dialogue boxes to complete these fields is not mandatory, a 
figure can simply be entered into each field.</P><P>
<H3>CCJ History: </H3> this screen also asks how many <A href="GENERIC TERMS.doc#CCJs (County Court Judgements):">CCJs</A> the 
applicant has had previously. 
<P></P>
<P><H3>Loan Details: </H3>the purchase price of the property must be entered, this will be used later on in this section to calculate the <A href="GENERIC TERMS.doc#LTV (Loan To Value):">LTV</A>.

<P><STRONG>Clicking on ‘OK’ leads to the next screen.</STRONG></P>
