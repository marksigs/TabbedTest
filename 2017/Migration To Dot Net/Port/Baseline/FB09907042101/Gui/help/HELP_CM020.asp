<P></P>
<P><FONT color=red><STRONG>NOTE: </STRONG>areas shown in red are mandatory and must be completed to 
proceed</FONT>           </P>
<P><H3>Product Name: </H3>this is a drop down menu that 
displays a list of the various products available.
<P></P>
<P><H3>Cover Type: </H3>this is also a drop down menu with 
options.
<P></P>
<P>Postcode: The postcode is often used in calculating the premium, as the area 
the applicant lives in is given an insurance risk rating, and those in, for 
example, areas of known subsidence, may be charged more or have subsidence 
excluded from the perils covered.</P>
<P><H3>Amount of Excess: </H3>Products may have varying 
amounts of excess built into them, or applicants may be able to set the excess 
they want to pay. The amount of excess chosen may impact the level of the 
premium paid.
<P></P>
<P><H3>Accidental Damage Cover: </H3>The premium will be 
higher if this additional risk is included.
<P></P>
<P><H3>Subsidence / heave / landslip / flooding / erosion: </H3>these are all factors that can affect the value of the property, and 
therefore whether the property is suitable security for the mortgage. This will 
be determined by the valuation report. Existence of any of these matters is 
likely to increase the premium for buildings insurance, they may be excluded 
from the perils covered by the policy.
<P></P>
<P><H3>Burglar Alarm: </H3>if the applicant has a burglar 
alarm, the premium for contents cover will be reduced, as the property will be 
seen as having better security.
<P></P>
<P><H3>Belongings away from the home:</H3>most contents 
policies will have this attached, and this can be included in the quote if it is 
available with the product selected, by clicking the ‘yes’ button.
<P></P>
<P><H3>Total valuables: </H3>Valuables are classed as those 
items of value that come under the following general headings: stamp, coin or 
model collections, curios, artwork, gold, silver, or other precious metals. 
Click the YES radio button if the applicant expects the total value of such 
items to be in excess of £10000.00.
<P></P>
<P><H3>Valuables: </H3>if the applicant has any valuables 
individually valued at £500, details must be entered, as they may need to be 
insured separately. Click on ‘Valuables’, and the ‘Valuables Over Limit’ 
dialogue box appears. Enter a description of the item in the ‘Description’ 
field, then enter the value. If there is more than one item, click add, and the 
details entered will appear in the box at the top. Enter all further items, then 
click on ‘OK’ to return to the main screen.
<P></P>
<P><H3>Number of Claims in last five years: </H3>this affects 
the premium and is a standard question asked by providers of insurance. The more 
claims, the higher the premium.
<P></P>
<P><H3>Payment Frequency: </H3>this can normally be monthly or 
annually
<P></P>
<P><H3>Calculate: </H3>when all the details have been entered, 
click ‘calculate’, and the premium will appear in the ‘Cost’ field. The ‘Status’ 
field shows whether the application has been accepted. The ‘Reason for Status’ 
field will provide a brief explanation of the status.

<P><H3>New Sub-Quote: </H3>pressing the ‘New Sub-Quote’ button 
clears the quote and allows the details to be changed.

<A HREF="HELP_CM075.asp">CM075 (View Sub-Quotes)</A>. Sub-quotes are those that have been provided but not 
accepted by the applicant.
<P></P>
<P>Clicking on ‘OK’ leads back to <A HREF="HELP_CM010.asp">CM010 – Cost Modelling Menu</A></P>
