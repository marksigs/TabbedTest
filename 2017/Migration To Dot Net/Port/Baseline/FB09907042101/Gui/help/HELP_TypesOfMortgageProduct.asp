<p><H1 align=center>TYPES OF MORTGAGE PRODUCT</H1>
<P></P>

<A NAME="FixedRate"></A><p><H3>Fixed rate: </H3>the interest rate of the mortgage is fixed at a specified rate for a specified term (eg. 2 years).  There is usually an <A href="HELP_FeesAssociatedWithMortgages.asp#ArrangementFee">arrangement fee</a> for this type of product, and if the mortgage is redeemed within the fixed rate period, there will often be an <A href="HELP_MortgageTerms.asp#EarlyRedemptionPenalty">early redemption penalty</a> payable.  The borrower may also be <A href="HELP_MortgageTerms.asp#LockIn">‘locked in’</a> after the fixed 
rate ends, being charged the redemption penalty if redemption were to occur 
during, for example, the year after the fixed rate ends.
<P></P>

<A NAME="SVR"></A><p><H3>SVR: </H3></B>Standard Variable Rate – this is specific 
to lenders but generally increases and decreases in line with the Bank of 
England Base Rate. If the product selected is a variable rate product, the 
borrower’s monthly repayments will increase and decrease in line with the 
fluctuating variable rate.
<P></P>

<A NAME="CappedRate"></A><b><H3>Capped rate: </H3></b>the interest rate is basically variable, increasing and decreasing in line with the lender’s <A href="HELP_TypesOfMortgageProduct.asp#SVR">SVR</a>. However, there is a 
upper fixed limit, so if the SVR increases above this limit, the interest rate 
will remain fixed at the capped rate.
<P></P>
<p>Eg. if the cap is 8%, and the SVR is 7.75%, the repayments will be calculated according to 7.75%.  However, should the interest rate rise to 8.25%, the interest rate applicable will remain at 8%.</p>

<A NAME="CappedAndCollared"></A><b><H3>Capped and floored (also known as capped and collared): </H3></b>this works in the same way as a <A href="HELP_TypesOfMortgageProduct.asp#CappedRate">capped rate</a>, but 
there is also a lower limit below which the interest rate will not fall.
<P></P>

<A NAME="DiscountedRate"><b><p><H3>Discounted rate: </H3></b>the interest rate is variable, but with a discount given on the <A href="HELP_TypesOfMortgageProduct.asp#SVR">SVR</a> for a specified period.  There may be an <A href="HELP_FeesAssociatedWithMortgages.asp#ArrangementFee">arrangement fee</a>, and an <A href="HELP_MortgageTerms.asp#EarlyRedemptionPenalty">early redemption penalty</a> will nearly always apply should all or part of the mortgage be 
redeemed during the discounted period (or discount will be ‘clawed back’ – ie. 
borrower will be required to pay back this amount to the lender)
<P></P>

<A NAME="CashbackMortgage"></A><b><H3>Cashback mortgage: </H3></b>with this type of product, a sum of money will be paid to the borrower on completion of the mortgage.  The cashback amount is usually a percentage of the loan amount (eg. 3% cashback on a £100,000 loan would be £3,000).  Cashbacks can be associated with other types of product, for example, <A href="HELP_TypesOfMortgageProduct.asp#DiscountedRate">discounted</a> or <A href="HELP_TypesOfMortgageProduct.asp#FixedRate">fixed</a> rate products.  If the mortgage is redeemed within a specified period, the cashback will be ‘clawed back’ (ie. the borrower will have to repay the cashback amount to the lender) or an <A href="HELP_MortgageTerms.asp#EarlyRedemptionPenalty">early redemption penalty</a> will apply.
<P></P>

<A NAME="FlexibleMortgage"></A><b><H3>Flexible mortgage: </H3></b>this is a type of mortgage 
where the borrower has more flexibility. The flexible element varies from lender 
to lender but generally the borrower can make extra payments and sometimes 
underpayments without paying a charge or penalty. Payment holidays are also 
sometimes available (ie. the borrower does not make mortgage repayments for a 
specified amount of months)
<P></P>

<A NAME="BaseRateTracker"></A><b><H3>Base Rate Tracker: </H3></b>these are relatively new 
mortgage products, where the interest rate of the mortgage ‘tracks’ the Bank of 
England Base Rate. 
<P></P>
</A><p>The Base Rate is the minimum rate at which banks are prepared to lend money, and is set by the Bank of England.  It acts as the benchmark for other interest rates, including mortgage rates.  With a Base Rate Tracker (BRT) product, the interest rate is a specified percentage above this rate for either a specified term or for the life of the mortgage.  Monthly repayments will increase or decrease in line with changes in the Base Rate.</p>
<p>E.g. the interest rate may be set at 0.75% above the Base Rate for the whole mortgage term</p>
