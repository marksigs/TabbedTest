<P>This screen collects a detailed breakdown of the applicant’s income. It is 
important to complete this screen accurately, as income types are treated 
differently in assessing how much an applicant can borrow, and whether they can 
afford the monthly repayments based on the amount they have requested. Eg. basic 
income is calculated according to the normal income multiples, however 
guaranteed overtime or bonus may be subjected to different criteria, and if a 
bonus etc. is not guaranteed, it may not be included at all.</P>
<P>To enter an amount for each type of income, highlight the item and enter the 
amount in the ‘Amount’ field below. To the right of the ‘Amount’ field, enter 
the frequency of the payment from the drop-down list. As each type of income is 
entered, the Total Gross Income (per annum) will be calculated.</P>
<P><H3>Total Net Monthly Income: </H3>this should be entered, 
based on the amount the applicant earns each month net of tax and National 
Insurance
