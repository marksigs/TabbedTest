<P><H1 align=center>APPLICATION MENU – MN060</H1>
<P></P>
<P>This is the main application menu, comprising of five areas:</P>
<P><H3>- Quick Quote</H3>
<P></P>
<P> Having already captured certain Applicant details in Customer Registration, 
additional Loan and Property information is required and is captured in Quick 
Quote so that the Costs Modelling exercise can take place.</P>
<P><H3>- Agreement in Principle </H3>
<P></P>
<P> With the Applicants having been registered or identified, the next phase is 
Agreement In Principle Data Capture, the first part of the system where 
Application information is collected. </P>
<P><H3>- Cost Modelling </H3>
<P></P>
<P> Costs Modelling is the function that produces the costs of the mortgage 
plus any Life Cover, Home Insurance and Payment Protection. Costs Modelling uses 
previously captured Application and Applicant data, and processes the 
Application from offering valid Mortgage Products to the Applicants through to 
the calculation of the ‘Package’ costs for all products.&nbsp;</P>
<P><H3>- Mortgage Application </H3>
<P></P>
<P> This stage collects the balance of the data required to process the 
mortgage application. </P>
<P><H3>- Application Processing </H3>
<P></P>
<P> Task Management, also known as Mortgage Application Processing, covers the 
managed progression of business activities that occur from Agreement In 
Principle data capture to the Completion Stage. Click on the relevant button to 
get the required area of the system. </P>
